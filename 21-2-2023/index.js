//ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS

//Simple Assignment Operator
let number = 10;

//Addition Assignment Operator
let x = 5;
x += 10; //x = x + 10
console.log("The value of x after adding its value with 10 is:", x);

//Subtraction Assignment Operator
let y = 5;
y -= 10; //y = y - 10
console.log("The value of y after subtracting its value with 10 is:", y);

//Division Assignment Operator
let z = 5;
z /= 10; //z = z / 10
console.log("The value of z after dividing its value with 10 is:", z);

//Multiplication Assignment Operator
let a = 5;
a *= 10; //a = a * 10
console.log("The value of a after multiplying its value with 10 is:", a);

//Multiplication Assignment Operator
let b = 5;
b %= 10; //b = b % 10
console.log("The value of b after taking modulus of its value with 10 is:", b);

//Multiplication Assignment Operator
let c = 5;
c **= 10; //c = c ** 10
console.log("The value of c raise to power 10 is:", c);

//RELATIONAL OPERATORS

//Equals To (==)
console.log("5 is equals to 5?", 5 == "5");
console.log("5.5 is equals to 5.5?", "5.5" == 5.5);
console.log("Two strings are equal?", "hassan" == "hassan");

//Identity Equals To (===)
console.log("5 is strictly equals to 5?", 5 === "5");
console.log("5.5 is strictly equals to 5.5?", "5.5" === 5.5);
console.log("Two strings are strictly equal?", "hassan" === "hassan");

//Not Equals to (!=)

console.log("5 is not equals to 5:", "5" != 5);
console.log("5.5 is not equals to 5.5:", 5.5 != 5.5);
console.log("two strings are not equal:", "hassan" != "hassan");

//Identity Not Equals to (!==)
console.log("5 is not equals to 5:", "5" !== 5);
console.log("5.5 is not equals to 5.5:", 5.5 !== 5.5);
console.log("two strings are not equal:", "hassan" !== "hassan");

//Greater Than (>)
console.log("6 is greater than 5:", 6 > 5);

//Greater than equals to (>=)
console.log("6 is greater or equal to 5:", 6 >= 5);

//Less Than (<)
console.log("6 is less than 5:", 6 < 5);

//Less than equals to (<=)
console.log("6 is less or equal to 5:", 6 <= 5);
